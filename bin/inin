\unified and simplified cross-distro and cross-platform package management

commands:
\tinin search package         # find a package by name
\tinin refresh                # get latest package list (may also upgrade package manager itself)
\tinin upgrade                # upgrade outdated packages

in progress:
\tinin search --all package   # TODO: find a package by looking in description and tag fields as well
\tinin search --regex \"^pack\" # TODO: find a package by regex of name
\tinin download package       # TODO: download package file
\tinin install package        # TODO: install package by name
\tinin install ./package.deb  # TODO: install package from file
\tinin upgrade package        # TODO: upgrade just this one package to the latest without touching depdendencies
\tinin upgrade --deps package # TODO: upgrade just this package and its dependencies
\tmore package managers       # TODO: scoop (Windows), pkgman (Haiku), eopkg (Solus)
