\tunified and simplified cross-distro and cross-platform package management

commands:
\tinin (se)arch                 # find a package by name
\tinin (in)stall                # install a package
\tinin (r)e(m)ove                 # remove and uninstall package
\tinin (fi)les                  # list the files from a named package
\tinin (re)fresh                # get latest package list (may also upgrade package manager itself)
\tinin (up)grade                # upgrade outdated packages
\tinin (d)own(l)oad package       # download package file
\tinin i(nf)o                   # display info for package
\tinin (f)i(n)d                 # find which package provides given file (some managers can only search installed packages)

in progress:
\tinin search --all package   # TODO: find a package by looking in description and tag fields as well
\tinin search --regex \"^pack\" # TODO: find a package by regex of name
\tinin install ./package.deb  # TODO: install package from file
\tinin upgrade package        # TODO: upgrade just this one package to the latest without touching depdendencies
\tinin upgrade --deps package # TODO: upgrade just this package and its dependencies
\tinin -m eopkg               # TODO: specify a package manager (for when multiple are available)
\tmore package managers       # TODO: scoop (Windows), pkgman (Haiku), others...
